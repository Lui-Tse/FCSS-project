## Research question(s):
We aim to test if there is a correlation between people’s emotions and the 2022 World Cup performance. We know World Cup is such incredible anticipation that the best players battling as a team fight for their country. Hence, we are curious if the emotion of the global fans will correlate with team performance or even the game result. To measure this relationship, we focus on Twitter tweets during the World Cup to measure people's sentiments.


## Planned data retrieval and analysis to address the questions:
**1.**  Based on the dataset (https://fbref.com/en/comps/1/stats/World-Cup-Stats), we will use **(Gls - GA)/2** per game as performance measurement, Gls: goals per game and GA: goals against per game.

**2.**  Python package “**Snscrape**” will use to extract people’s emotions during World Cup.

**3.**  Evaluate against sentiment analysis, **VADER**, and will calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation sentiment scores.

**4.**  Data visualization and correlation test.
